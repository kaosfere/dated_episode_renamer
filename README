dated_episode_renamer.py

This is a simple python script which helps solve the problem of several popular
daily television shows being posted online with their air date as the primary
identifying information -- this conflicts with the standard season/episode
numbering method used by most shows.


BASIC USAGE:

  ./dated_episode_renamer.py my.show.2010.03.01.title.avi

  This will look up the name of the show on thetvdb.com, and search all episodes
  for the one which aired on 1 March 2010, then rename it to, for example:

  My Show - 1x01 (2010-03-01) - Show Title.avi


OPTIONS:

  -d <path>: Directory to move the renamed show to when done

  -v: Operate in verbose mode, providing a little more output
  -D: Delete the directory that the file is now in, after moving it
       (Can only be used if -d is also provided)


NOTES:

  Currently the formatting for the output filename is hardcoded based on my own
  personal preferences.  This will be changed in a future version. 

  The current implementation uses DOM, as that is what I'm most familiar with.
  This does have some performance penalties when slurping down long-running
  shows with many episodes (like The Daily Show).  I would like to reimplement
  it using SAX instead to see how the performance improves

  This script uses the API provided by http://www.thetvdb.com.  Please try to
  avoid abusing their services (and my API key).  If you're going to be using
  this script extensively, I'd urge you to apply for your own key at
  http://thetvdb.com/?tab=apiregister.

  Even if you don't plan on using a new key, the site would like to encourage
  you to register and help maintain the database they provide for free
